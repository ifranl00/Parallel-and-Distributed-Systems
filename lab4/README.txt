	For testing clauses, we need first to compile example.c, ex3_4.c, ex5.c and because we are using openmpi for gcc compilers we can enter the following line in the console and then, execute the program like:

		$ gcc programname.c -o exe -fopenmp
		$ ./exe

	(programname is example.c or ex3_4.c or ex5.c and the executables are example, exe3_4, exe5)
