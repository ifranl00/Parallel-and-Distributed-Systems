/**********************LAB 2**********************/

**Exercise 01:
	
	We can appreciate if we run the program several times that the threads are not executing in the order of creation. It occurs because the threads raise up and the is not garanty of the order of execution because it depends of the time assigned to them by the CPU.

**Exercise 02:

	For using time functions, I imported the library and use tmeas.h and time.h, so I adapted the makefile of the lab1. 
	Please, for running and compiling exercise02_lab2 program, enter "make all" in the command line and then, execute it like ./exercise02_lab2

**Exercise 03:

	I edited the program to do the add operation with threads and each thread add its frangment. If you used make all beafore, you just need to execute it because the program has already been compiled.

**Exercise 04:

	We execute it like the last program, and we can see that the times of the threads are different.
