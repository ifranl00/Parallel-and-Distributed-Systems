/*
	PDP WINTER PROJECT: program 1

	1. Design a program to simulate the lift. Passengers come to random floors and if the lift is idle, they
	call for it. When the lift is in motion, the passenger has to wait on his floor, until it becomes idle and
	then he can invoke it. It may happen that the lift will stop on the floor because someone is getting
	off. In such case it can take passengers, who are going in the same direction as the lift. The lift is
	idle on the floor where all the passengers leaves it and no one is waiting for it. The program should
	be made with the use of MPI.
